# SoloTech Kotlin (STK.beta version)

Welcome to me attempting to teach you while also learn the **Kotlin** language.

This repo will serve as an blueprint with small detail of code defining.

This repo is for whoever wants to learn kotlin, yea know, dive into the neaty greaty things,

such as basic programming concepts (medthods, functions, conditional) all the way too advance.


## Getting Started

* Tools
 - **Kotlin.CLI** (feel free to use an IDE)

If you are not using an *IDE* (Intellij for instance), but in stead, also using **Kotlin.CLI** then well

need away to compile our *Kotlin code* to *Java code*.


compile *Kotlin* file to java then save it to a *java* file 

```kotlinc kotlin_file.kt -include-runtime -d java_file.jar```

* ```Kotlinc``` stands for kotlin compiler.

* ```kotlin_file.kt``` is the *kotlin file* which we'll be compiling to java.

* ```-include-runtime``` option makes the resulting .jar file self-contained and runnable.

* ```-d``` indecates the output path.
